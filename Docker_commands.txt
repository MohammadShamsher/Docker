To create Dockerfile
echo > Dockerfile


To check docker version
docker --version


To create Docker image from dokcerfile
docker build -t flask_application:latest .
  
  
  
To run docker image 8070 is default so we do port mapping it to 8082
docker run -p 8082:8070 flask_application
  
To check all running images
docker ps 
 
To stop Container
docker stop id_write


To check all docker images
docker images ls


to download any image from dockerhub
docker put name_of_image


to run image 
docker run nameof_image



To run image in detach mode,To run container even if we hav eexited our terminal, bydefault without detach mode container will get stop if we close terminal
docker run -d nameof_image



it prints all container regardless its status
docker ps -a    




print container which are active
docker ps  



To print all container id
docker ps -a -q



To stop container from running 
docker stop containerid werka




To remove container  but stop it before
docker rm container_id_werka




To remove container  forecefully without stoping it
docker rm -f container_id_werka




To remove All Containers 
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)



To remove 1 image
docker rmi -f id_of_image


To remove All images
docker rmi $(docker image ls -q)


For Port Mapping 8080 is default it will change to 9000  if any our container is using port 8080 and it is not free. So we transfer our new container to our custom port
docker run -p 9000:8080  image_werka


To Rename Container
docker run --name hello prev_conatiner_name



Attach mode (also known as foreground mode) here if you close your terminal container will get stop( bydefault)

Detach Mode (also known as background mode) here if even you close your terminal still container will up and running.My application will up and running.
docker run -dp 9000:8080  image_werka



To change name of docker image
docker tag getting-started-javascript mohammadshamsher123/getting-started-javascript

To push docker image to docker hub
docker push mohammadshamsher123/getting-started-javascript:latest


Create Network so containers can interact with each other
docker network create todo-app 


creating mysql image 
In v (the data will get store it is volume means locally data will get store at this area var/lib/mysql                                   
docker run -d --network todo-app -v todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=tiger123 -e MYSQL_DATABASE=todo_db mysql:8.0


To get Inside Container
docker exec -it container_id_werka mysql -u root -p


To create network between docker application_image and mysql_image (nikolaka/netshoot image is used)
docker run -it --network todo-app nicolaka/netshoot

To check IP through which the connection will get establish Run it after netshoot 
dig mysql


Give permissions to root user with password set in creating mysql image
ALTER USER 'root' IDENTIFIED with mysql_native_password BY 'tiger123';
flush privileges;


Running application Image with Mysql image with connections from above all considerations
docker run -p 3000:3000 -w /app -v "$(pwd):/app" --network todo-app -e MYSQL_HOST=mysql -e MYSQL_USER=root -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=tiger123 -e MYSQL_DB=todo_db node:18-alpine sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"



Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define your application's services, networks, and volumes in a single YAML file, and then start and stop your application using a single command.
